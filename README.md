# LCS-using-Dynamic-Programming
Find the Longest Common Subsequence using Dynamic programming
Given two strings, find the longest comment sub-sequence (LCS).
 * The class calculates and returns the LCS.
 * Example:
 * For "AGGTAB" and "GXTXAYB", the LCS is "GTAB", return the longest common subsequence and compute the length of LCS
 * Here "AGGTAB" is sequence 1 and "GXTXAYB" is the sequence 2
